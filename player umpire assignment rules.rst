        - 

fill umpire roster bottom up in terms of grades and number of games umpired already:

- start with games at lowest grade i.e. 10s
- build umpire list based games major / minor grade for each game in grade
- clamp umpires of a score range to avoid top level umpire doing base level game
- from the lowest minor grade in this grade i.e. E assign umpire:
        - with the lowest score
        - with the lowest number of games umpired
